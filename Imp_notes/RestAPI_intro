Q- What do you mean by rest ApI automation?
	A- Every API has a payload which is a data which API will consume.
	Sometime delete call does or doesn't require data.
	
	Every Request is coming under the arraylist. Under the arraylist, we have multiple maps.
	
	For ex-> Request data or payload..it has 2 maps with Address as a class.
	[ {
		"name": "Atul",
		"surname": "Upadhyay",
		"address":{
			"city": "Aligarh",
			"state": "Uttar pradesh",
			"zipcode": "201301",
			"landmark":"testlandmark"
		}
	},
	
	{
		"name": "Ashish",
		"surname": "Upadhyay",
		"address":{
			"city": "Aligarh",
			"state": "Uttar pradesh",
			"zipcode": "201301",
			"landmark":"testlandmark1"
		}
	}]
	
	go to jsonschema2json.org and paste this request data. It will generate 2 class - one for Address and one for upper layer data.
	
Use this war file placed under the service package, place it in webapps, so that you can get the service. After that you start the tomcat, go to the 
bin folder, then click on start.bat file there

Q- We need to see when response comes from the server, 	we need to parse it and we need to put the verification. We already create response pojo classes. We will instantiate the POJO classes from 
the response we got from the server.then we put the assertion.
